# HomeGrown

Start your gardening/ botanical/ agricultural journey here!
HomeGrown is a simple user interface with a few key functions:
(1) a search that allow you to look up plants native to your region by city (which may help with foraging)
(2) Planty (to choose from): a page where you can like or dislike plants to determine your floral tastes
(3) a map that you can use to determine which food plants your region is most suitable for growing

##Inspiration
Our attention was captured by the nonprofit organizations that sought to combat the ["food deserts"](https://www.aecf.org/blog/exploring-americas-food-deserts) in certain high-crime communities through community gardens. We recognized gardening to be not just effective in reducing one's carbon footprint (by contributing less to the transportation of goods, and processed materials), but also as an important method to alleviate food insecurity and empower communities.

##Tools
Replit was out primary platform because it allowed live collaboration, and one of our groupmates was having issues downloading VS code! Since most of us were beginners to web deb at our first hackathon, it seemed advantageous for us to practice pair programming in real time.
We also used Trefle, an API of native plants to get our data on plants.
